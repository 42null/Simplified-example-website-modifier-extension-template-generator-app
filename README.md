# Simplified-example-website-modifier-extension-template-generator-app
This is .NET7 MAUI crossplatform application made to customize the config files for the project at https://github.com/42null/Simplified-example-website-modifier-extension-template (a boilerplate webextension) for quick &amp; simplified creation of new forks.

THIS PROJECT IS CONNECTED TO MY BOILERPLATE/EXAMPLE EXTENSION AND RETURN-YOUTUBE-UI, UPDATES MAY TAKE TIME TO PROAGATE BETWEEN PROJECTS.

(Most visual work has been done under dark mode, expect light mode graphics to be harder on the eyes for the time being)
